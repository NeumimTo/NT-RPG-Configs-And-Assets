# NT-RPG-Configs-And-Assets

The conf files use an additive style of stats; Where in the total sum of the bonuses are used as the bonus, not the highest value (NT-RPG defaults)

Because of this you must use the Settings.conf provided; 
or change 61 "WEAPON_MERGE_STRATEGY":2 to "WEAPON_MERGE_STRATEGY":1 in your personal Settings.conf
