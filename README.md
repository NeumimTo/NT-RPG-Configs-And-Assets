# NT-RPG-Configs-And-Assets

Files in this Repository are for use with NT-RPG the wonderful API plugin for Sponge by NeumimTo

The conf files in this repository use an additive style of stats; Where in the total sum of the bonuses are used as the bonus, not the highest value (NT-RPG defaults)

Because of this you must use the Settings.conf provided; 
or change line 61 in your in your personal Settings.conf "WEAPON_MERGE_STRATEGY":2 to "WEAPON_MERGE_STRATEGY":1
